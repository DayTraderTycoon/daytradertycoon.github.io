Added the ability to better control stock volatility throughout the day. Until now, I had one seed for each day that controlled the random movements of the stocks, usually giving a small trend upwards or downwards for each day. I recently added the ability to change the direction of the stocks for specific hours, allowing me to provide story elements that relate to the full story.

In the image, you can see "extreme" changes in the random movements of stocks. This is on purpose to test the feature, but I like the way it lets me play with the story. For example, I can now add news articles like "Earthquake hit the shores of LA, stock market trends downwards" and change the total trend of the market to go down.
