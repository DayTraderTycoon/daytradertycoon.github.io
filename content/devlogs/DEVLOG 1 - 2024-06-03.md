I've been working on a small game named Day Trader Tycoon as a side project for the past few months, and I think it's in a good-enough state for me to post about it.

To set the stage, here is a screenshot of the game:

The main setting of the game is that the player works in a pension fund, and they day-trade with people's pension money. The game aims to be a parody of the stock market, with a combination of a linear story and many different random events.

The main gameplay loop consists of the player having access to industry news, with many different articles about things related to different companies, as well as the market in general. Time moves quickly, and the player needs to make Buy / Sell decisions based on the info they have.

I also plan to have a small story for the game, with the player interacting in some way with their bosses / other people in the pension fund they work in. I'm still working on it, but one idea I had is for the player to be able to take place in pump-and-dump schemes, and potentially win / lose a lot of money.

The game is playable with many random events but no solid story at the moment. The end goal for me is to have a ~5-6 hour story,m but for the game to be replayable and feel different every time, at least for a few times.

My main objective currently is to create a basic playable build with 5 days of gameplay.

I published a small video of a day in the game:

Other than the build, my next goal is to improve the UX and include tags and related stocks in the industry news to make it more usable. Also, figuring out the proper pacing for the game and building the story are also the next priorities.
