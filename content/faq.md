**Q: When is the release date?**

**Q: How much will it cost?**

A: I haven't decided yet, my current guess is around 10$.

---

**Q: How many hours can the game be played?**

A: My aim is for the game's story to be about 5 hours of gameplay, however there will also definitely be a replayability, with different events and stock movements every time. That means that between 2 different playthroughs, the player will see completely different events and market conditions, making the game perfect for multiple runs.

I am still considering the inclusion of an "endless" mode, as it can potentially really fit well in the game, but that's further down the line.

**Q: How is the game funded? Do you plan on using Kickstarter?**

A: The game is entirely self-funded, with no plans for Kickstarter or any other crowdfunding platform at the moment.
