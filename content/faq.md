**Q: When is the release date?**

A: No release date yet, however I am aiming for the next few months, meaning somewhere between July-October 2024.

That being said, a basic playable demo should be available at June 2024, however it's more of an alpha-state demo than a demo of the completed product.

**Q: How much will it cost?**

A: I haven't decided yet, my current guess is around 11$.

**Q: How many hours can the game be played?**

A: My aim is for the game's story to be about 5 hours of gameplay, however there will also definitely be a replayability, with different events and stock movements every time. That means that between 2 different playthroughs, the player will see completely different events and market conditions, making the game perfect for multiple runs.

I am still considering the inclusion of an "endless" mode, as it can potentially really fit well in the game, but that's further down the line.

**Q: What platforms will the game be available on?**

A: PC only, on Windows, Mac and Linux.

**Q: How is the game funded? Do you plan on using Kickstarter?**

A: The game is entirely self-funded, with no plans for Kickstarter or any other crowdfunding platform at the moment.
