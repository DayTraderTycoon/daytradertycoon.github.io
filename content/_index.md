**Day Trader Tycoon** is an indie game that aims to be a parody of the stock market. 

Your goal is simple: Make as much money as possible by day-trading. You'll need to quickly react to market events, such as new announcements from companies, market conditions and black-swan events.

The game is fast paced, with the player needing to quickly react to market events. 

The game is made by one person with an indie budget. I am aiming for a playable demo in June 2024.
