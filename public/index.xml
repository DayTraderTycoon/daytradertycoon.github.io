      <description>Added the ability to better control stock volatility throughout the day. Until now, I had one seed for each day that controlled the random movements of the stocks, usually giving a small trend upwards or downwards for each day. I recently added the ability to change the direction of the stocks for specific hours, allowing me to provide story elements that relate to the full story.
In the image, you can see &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; changes in the random movements of stocks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a small game named Day Trader Tycoon as a side project for the past few months, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s in a good-enough state for me to post about it.
To set the stage, here is a screenshot of the game:
The main setting of the game is that the player works in a pension fund, and they day-trade with people&amp;rsquo;s pension money. The game aims to be a parody of the stock market, with a combination of a linear story and many different random events.</description>

      <description>Q: When is the release date?
A: No release date yet, however I am aiming for the next few months, meaning somewhere between July-October 2024.
That being said, a basic playable demo should be available at June 2024, however it&amp;rsquo;s more of an alpha-state demo than a demo of the completed product.
Q: How much will it cost?
A: I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided yet, my current guess is around 11$.
Q: How many hours can the game be played?</description>
