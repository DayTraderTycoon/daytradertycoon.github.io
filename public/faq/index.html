A: No release date yet, however I am aiming for the next few months, meaning somewhere between July-October 2024.
That being said, a basic playable demo should be available at June 2024, however it&rsquo;s more of an alpha-state demo than a demo of the completed product.
Q: How much will it cost?
A: I haven&rsquo;t decided yet, my current guess is around 11$.
